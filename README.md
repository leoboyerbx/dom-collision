## What is HitboxJS ?

HitboxJS is a JS library that can help you detect collisions or intersections between **elements in your DOM**.



It can be used if your are building complex interfaces with, for example, rectangle selection, or if you're building a game*.

> *If you are building a game, you are probably using a canvas so this library is not for you (and if not, maybe you should consider switching to canvas [for performance reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38901951/canvas-vs-svg-for-games)). HitboxJS only detects collisions and intersection **between DOM Elements**.

â€Œ

HitboxJS watches your elements and fires an event when **two elements** collide.

Learn to use HitboxJS by reading [the documentation](https://docs.hitbox.cf/).



## Installation

### In the browser

To import HitboxJS, simply place this tag before your script.  

```markup
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hitbox-js/dist/hitbox.dist.js"></script>  

<!-- Then you can import your script -->  
<script type="text/javascript" src="my.script.js"></script>  
```

## With a module bundler

If you are using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel, you need to add Hitbox as a dependency of your project.  

```bash
npm install --save hitbox-js  
```

Then you need to import it in your JS file  

```javascript
import Hitbox from 'hitbox-js'  
```
